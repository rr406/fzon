No HBD greeting for Nicholas b'coz he's a bad boy; I have to "dwink" my juice...Wanna go to Atlanta? Mummy will be alone. Roger Halls is scary, not a good man....First name vs last name<br>

Dad saw a cheetah today. Argument ensues: You got aangy at the cheetah? No I got scared. No, you got aangy....Elephant story... I want to disguise myself as a Papa Elephant. So funny<br>

Used to say "Hothapal"; came to DC on "Bwitish AIrways" Flight Ten-O-1; went high and high and landed in DC; Got off the plane and saw Daddy and ran to Daddy<br>
